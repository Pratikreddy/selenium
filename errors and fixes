1) this errror was because of versioning of chrome and chrome driver this is the most common error when im using selenium
better to always use separate environments with auto updates tp chrome turned off for any longterm or important scripts. 


      or we can just remove this casche file so its recreated with new and relevant info 

       rm -rf ~/.wdm
